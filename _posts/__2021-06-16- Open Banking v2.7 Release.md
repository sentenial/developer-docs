We're pleased to announce our v2.7 Open Banking Release.

* A new Open Banking Payment & Direct Debit Setup option has been introduced in this release in UK Open Banking. This feature will allow merchants to take an initial Open Banking payment and then prompt the PSU to sign up for Bacs Direct Debit for subsequent payments.
* The standard CHECKOUT and REDIRECT User Interface has been updated in this release.
* The Timeout period for an Open Banking payment may now be set via the Create Payment (POST /payments) API.
* We have introduced better handling of GBP payments where multiple authorisations are required.
