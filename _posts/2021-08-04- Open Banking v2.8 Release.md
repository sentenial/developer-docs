We're pleased to announce our v2.8 Open Banking Release. In this release:

* We have added support to manage bank entities that are configured as a hierarchy. We have extended the `GET /banks` service and introduced two new endpoints.
* In certain banks operating under the Berlin Group specification, PSUs are prompted to provide their bank identification customer code (PSU-ID). We have added support for this to be provided on the UI in this release (i.e. for CHECKOUT and REDIRECT integrations).
*	The response to the `GET /banks service` has been enhanced and now returns additional information.
*	We have introduced support for French and German for clients who integrate via CHECKOUT or REDIRECT.
