title: Partner PISP Redirect Payment Page Setup
keywords: Redirect Payment Page Setup Javascript Add Open Banking Payment Page
summary: "Adding Open Banking (Redirect mode) as a payment option to your Payment Page requires a little configuration as outlined below. In Redirect mode you will use the Nuapay user interface for Bank Selection and Confirmation screens, with the screens being launched in a new browser window. Alternatively, you can use this mode if you would like to implement a setup where PSUs are emailed a link to the Bank Selection page or scan a QR code, for example."

## Overview

Redirect mode allows merchants to:

* Use the Nuapay User Interface for the bank selection and bank confirmation screens.
* Offer a full browser window/tab for the PSU interaction (this is in contrast to [CHECKOUT](ob_checkoutoverview.html) mode, where the bank selection and bank confirmation screens are rendered in a pop-up window).
* Create a payment link which can be presented to the PSU.

## Steps in the Redirect Flow
A detailed overview of the various steps involved in the **REDIRECT** flow is provided in the image below.

{% include image.html file="ob_redirect_flow-partner.png" url="images/ob_redirect_flow-partner.png" target = "_new" alt="Redirect Flow - Partner" caption="REDIRECT Flow - Partner" %}


In **Redirect** mode you will: 

1. Use your partner-level API key to retrieve a token representing the required merchant. (For more on this see [list organisations](ob_partnerintegration.html#api-details---get-organisations) and [retrieving tokens](ob_partnerintegration.html#api-details---post-tokens)).
1. Call the `/payments` endpoint (see [Create Payment](ob_createpayment.html)), on behalf of the merchant, using the OAuth token retrieved in the previous step. 
1. Set the `integrationType` to `REDIRECT`. You must also provide the `merchantPostAuthUrl` - this is mandatory for the Redirect flow. 
1. The TPP creates the payment object and returns the `userInterfacePaymentId`.
1. The <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.psu}}">PSU</a> then needs to be redirected to the URL with the `userInterfacePaymentId`. You must build a URI that can be used on a web page or sent by an e-mail to the end user. The URL will be similar to the following (on the Production environment): 
   * `https://api.nuapay.com/tpp-ui/redirect?uiid=<userInterfacePaymentId>`
1. The end user clicks the link and the <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.nupay_tpp}}">Nuapay TPP</a> (with the Bank selection window) is displayed in a new browser window.
1. When the user selects a bank he/she is redirected to the selected <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.aspsp}}">ASPSP</a> to authorise the payment.
1. The ASPSP redirects the PSU back to the TPP UI which processes that callback. 
1. The TPP UI then redirects the PSU to the `merchantPostAuthUrl` with the parameter `paymentId`.
1. Use [Retrieve Payment](ob_retrievepayment.html) to determine the final payment status. (This integration also supports webhooks so you can be informed when the payment is completed). 

## Authorisation 

An API Key or an OAuth token uniquely identifies you on Nuapay and is required to allow you to use our API services.

For more on API Keys and OAuth, see the <a href="ob_generalrules.html">API Basics</a> section.


## Calling the Payment Endpoint

The Open Banking payment endpoint returns a payment identifier on a successful invocation.

To generate a payment ID:

1. Generate a server-to-server call to `/payments`.
1. Ensure that you have referenced your API Key or OAuth token in the request.
1. The ``/payments`` service is described in <a href="ob_createpayment.html">Create Payment</a>.


## Adding the CSS and JS File References

On your payment page you will need to add the following:

**For Sandbox**

````
<script src="https://sandbox.nuapay.com/tpp-ui/js/nuapay-open-banking.js"></script>
````

**For Production**

````
<script src="https://api.nuapay.com/tpp-ui/js/nuapay-open-banking.js"></script>
````

## Adding The Open Banking Pay Button

At this point you have:

* Added the JS and CSS links to your payment page.
* Retrieved the payment ID (via the Create Payment service).

To enable the <span class="label label-info">PAY</span> button you will need to add an ``onclick`` event. See the example below:

````
<a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" onclick="NuapayOpenBanking.redirect(uiid, tppUibaseUrl);">Pay Now</a>

````

This button will open the Select Banks on a new browser tab or window for the `userInterfacePaymentId` (the `uiid`).

Note that there is a Sandbox and Production TPP for this so you will need to specify the correct URL based on whether you are testing or working in Production:

|**SANDBOX**|https://sandbox.nuapay.com/tpp-ui/|
|**PRODUCTION**| https://api.nuapay.com/tpp-ui/|

## Reusing the Link

If you have decided to email the link to the <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.psu}}">PSU</a> or have provided a QR code, that user may begin the payment, drop out of the flow and retry accessing the link later. In that case:

* Where a link is accessed, the TPP will check the existing payment status in the TPP database. 
* If the payment's current status means that the payment cannot proceed (e.g. if the payment is in `SETTLEMENT_REJECTED`) an alert is displayed to the user on the TPP and he/she cannot continue. 
* If the payment is in status `PENDING` then the user will be able to proceed and complete the payment. Note that `PENDING` is the only status that will allow the PSU to proceed.

{% include note.html content="If the PSU goes to the ASPSP and cancels, the [Payment Declined Webhook](ob_whpaymentdecl.html) is triggered. However if the PSU reuses that payment link later, the payment status will revert to `PENDING`, allowing the user to complete the payment, if required." %}
