To add Open Banking to your payment page you will need to carry out the following steps:

1. Use your partner-level API key to retrieve a token representing the required merchant (see [list of your merchants](ob_partnerintegration.html#api-details---get-organisations) and [Retrieving a Token](ob_partnerintegration.html#api-details---post-tokens) for more on this).
1. Call GET `/banks` to retrieve a list of all supported banks (see [Retrieve Banks](ob_getbank.html)) to populate your Bank Selection screen. Where banks have specific branches (bank families), you will also need to call the [View Bank Families](ob_getbankfamilies.html) endpoint. (See the section on Bank Families below for more information on this).
1. Once the payer has selected a bank, call the `/payments` endpoint using the OAUth token, representing the required merchant, (see [Create Payment](ob_createpayment.html)).
Set the `integrationType` to `SELF_HOSTED`, specify the `bankId` provided by the payer and set the `merchantPostAuthUrl` (this can be the partner or merchant URL). This will return the `aspspAuthUrl`, to which you can redirect your <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.psu}}">PSU</a>.
1. Your payer interacts with the selected <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.aspsp}}">ASPSP</a> to authorise the payment.
1. The <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.nupay_tpp}}">Nuapay TPP</a> posts the payment ID to the partner/merchant URL (`merchantPostAuthUrl`). See details of the posting below.
1. Use [Retrieve Payment](ob_retrievepayment.html) to determine the final payment status, if required (an optional step) or, alternatively, use Webhooks.
