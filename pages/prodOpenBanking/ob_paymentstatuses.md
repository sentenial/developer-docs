## Overview

Open Banking Payments transition from an initial `PENDING` to any one of a number of possible statuses (note that some statuses are Nuapay-specific and are only relevant if you are using a Nuapay beneficiary account for your Open Banking payments).

The various statuses possible (for both payments and refunds) are presented in the tables below and as a state diagram:

</ul>
