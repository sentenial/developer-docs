It is possible to set up and manage the MTLS via the User Interface (as described in this section) or alternatively, this may be done via [REST](np_secmtlsrest.html).

## Uploading a Certificate via the UI

{% include note.html content="You will require access to the Nuapay Console to configure your MTLS settings via the User Interface. See the [Nuapay Console Overview](prod_consoleoverview.html) for more details." %}

To upload your certificate:

1. Navigate to the **PKI Management** screen on the Nuapay Console. (If you cannot see this as a menu option please contact your Account Manager - specific permissions must be enabled to allow you to access this section of the dashboard).
1. Click <b>Upload MTLS Certificate</b>:

1. Browse to **API Configuration** (left-hand menu).

1. Click **Save**.

## Additional Notes on MTLS

Note that:

* You can upload any certificate for MTLS [self signed certificates are permitted] i.e., you do not have to use Nuapayâ€™s `POST /certificates` endpoint.
* MTLS-enabled clients should call Nuapay APIs on Port 8443.
* You may register more than one client certificate. This is useful as it allows you to rotate certificates and allows you to avoid any potential downtime due to certificate expiry, for example.
