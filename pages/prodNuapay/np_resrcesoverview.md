The Resources section offers various reference documentation.
* Our FAQs and Use Cases sections are particularly useful and we'd encourage new users in particular to read through the Use Case section as it will give you some good pointers on how best to implement a Nuapay solution for your organisation.
* Check out the FAQs section. If you have a query please use the <b>Feedback</b> link at the top of this page to get in touch.
* We are always eager to help and look to improve your experience of working with our APIs and if your question can potentially assist other users we will publish it.

Finally, don't forget that you can use Github to Fork this Help and help us to improve it by making edits and initiating a pull request, which we will review and merge back to our master version once your edits are reviewed and approved by our Documentation department.
