## API Details

Use this request to return the balance on a specific account.
The response will return two balance amounts:

* BOOKED_BALANCE - the balance on the account at a given point in time.
* AVAILABLE_BALANCE - the balance amount that may be used to initiate Credit Transfer payments.

For example:
* An Account initially has a `BOOKED_BALANCE` = €1,000.00; `AVAILABLE_BALANCE` = €1,000.00
* A Credit Transfer for €400.00 is created with an execution date = _tomorrow_.
* When the payment is created it has an initial [status](np_ctstatuses.html) = PENDING (i.e. it is not immediately debited from the account and credited to the beneficiary); a reserve (or hold) is placed on the funds.
* After creating this payment, `BOOKED_BALANCE` = €1,000.00; `AVAILABLE_BALANCE` is now = €600.00.  

Note that:
* At this point, €1,0000.00 is still credited on the account (the `BOOKED_BALANCE`)
* €400.00 has been set aside for the payment that will be issued tomorrow.
* If you wanted to create a second Credit Transfer, at this point, you would only be able to create a payment up to a maximum value = €600.00 i.e. up to the total value of the `AVAILABLE_BALANCE`.
* Once the payment is successfully credited to the beneficiary on its execution date (_tomorrow_, in this example), the `BOOKED_BALANCE` is updated to €600.00.
