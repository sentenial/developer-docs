## Overview

In Direct Debit payments:

* A Direct Debit is linked to a mandate (in SEPA) or to a Direct Debit Instruction - a DDI (in Bacs).
* Direct Debit payments are **pulled** from your payers' accounts on the collection date and credited to your Nuapay merchant account.
* Depending on your business model you may decide to create single Direct Debit payments or, more typically, configure a schedule of recurring payments.
* For more information on Direct Debits see the [Direct Debit Overview](np_ddoverview.html) section.

## Scheme Overview

Every Direct Debit payment must be linked to a mandate or a DDI and every mandate/DDI must be linked to a specific scheme and currency. 

Nuapay supports the following Direct Debit schemes:

|**Scheme Name**|**Currency**|
|SEPA CORE| EUR|
|SPEA B2B| EUR|
|Bacs|GBP|

The SEPA scheme is managed by the European Payment Council. In the UK, Bacs is responsible for various payment schemes including the Direct Debit scheme. 

Both the EPC and Bacs publish guides and rulebooks (which are generally updated on an anual basis) related to how the schemes should be implemented. Nuapay is fully compliant with these rulebooks and constantly monitor and update our Direct Debit solution as required to ensure that we remain fully compliant.
