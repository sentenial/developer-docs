Direct Debit transactions can be unsuccessful for various reasons and when a payment fails, the original transaction's status is updated.

The new status will generally be set to one of the following:

* REJECTED
* REFUSED
* RETURNED
* REFUNDED

(Collectively these statuses are often referred to as R-transactions).

To help you to identify why the payment failed, error codes are provided by your payer's bank.

In this section we outline the various failed payments (R-transactions) and error codes that are possible, what they mean and what corrective action you should take based on the code.

{% include note.html content="The following guidance is based on the EPC recommendations (see the [EPC Web site](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/document-library/guidance-documents/guidance-reason-codes-sepa-direct-debit-r-transactions) for more details)." %}


{% include callout.html content="Certain error codes may be received both pre- and post-settlement.
Some banks may determine before the settlement date that your payer will have insufficient funds to make a payment; in this case you will receive a pre-settlement AM04 REJECT; other banks may wait until the actual settlement date to debit funds. If the funds are not available on the settlement date this would again result in an AM04 but in this scenario the R-transaction would be a post-settlement AM04 RETURN. In the table below the R-Transaction Type column indicates when the error code may be treated as a REJECT, CANCEL (pre-settlement) or a RETURN or a REFUND (post-settlement)." type="warning" %}
