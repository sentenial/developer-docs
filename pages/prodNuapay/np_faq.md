                            <p>When you register for the service you will be assigned a Nuapay IBAN. This is a virtual account that you will use as your merchant account when processing mandates and Direct Debit payments.</p>

                            <p>When you make direct debit settlements the funds you collect are initially credited to this virtual IBAN. On the settlement date the funds are then debited from this account and credited to your physical (real-world account) via a Credit Transfer. This is automatically handled by Nuapay in the majority of cases but may be manually manged by you if required - please discuss the available options with you Account Manager.</p>

                            <p><b>AUTHORISED</b>: In the case of an authorised refund the payer has claimed a refund for a transaction within an 8 week period of the initial debit on his/her account. The payer must be credited - you as a merchant cannot contest this, as per the SEPA CORE scheme rules.</p>

                            <p><b>UNAUTHORISED</b>: An unauthorised refund can occur after 8 weeks and within 13 months of the debit. In this scenario the payer's bank will lodge a request with your bank to provide proof of a mandate. Your bank will seek this proof from you and pass it to the payer's bank. If the payer's bank is satisfied that the mandate is valid then they will not seek to debit your account for the refund amount. If the mandate is not provided or the payer's bank deem that no mandate (and payer authorisation) was in place they will initiate a debit on your account to credit your payer's account.</p>

                            <p>A REFUSAL is a pre-settlement R-transaction. A payer may refuse your direct debit based on specific settings that they may have applied to their bank account.

                            For example the payer may have set a limit on the value of collections that may be debited in a single transaction. If your debit exceeds this limit then this will result in a REFUSAL (typically an MS02 - see <a href="np_separeasons.html">SEPA Error Codes</a> for more information)</p>
