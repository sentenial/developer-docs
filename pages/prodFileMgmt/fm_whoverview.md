Webhooks are HTTP notifications, dispatched to a specified URL when certain events are triggered in Nuapay.

For more information on the setup and configuration of Webhooks, see the general [Webhooks section](wh_overview.html) (under the Products menu).

When you upload a file via REST, Webhooks can be used to notify of:

* File Status updates
* Batch Status updates

{% include tip.html content="You may configure thesse Webhooks under the `File` and `Batch` areas of the Add Webhooks area of the [Nuapay Console](prod_consolewebhooks.html)" %}
