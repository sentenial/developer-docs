<p>
    Verifying account ownership before disbursing funds helps to prevent fraud and minimise the risk of misdirected payments.
    Verification allows you to validate beneficiary details prior to payment execution.
  </p>
            <p>

              Nuapay allows you to verify account holders in two ways, via:
<uL>
<li>Confirmation of Payee (CoP) / Verification of Payee (VoP)</li>
<li>Open Banking - AIS</li>
</uL>

{% include warning.html content="Verification via Open Banking AIS will be deprecated in November 2025 so we recommend using CoP (for UK clients) or VoP as your verification method." %}


 <h2 class="page-header">CoP and VoP</h2>

 <p>
  Account verification services, including Confirmation of Payee (CoP) in the UK and Verification of Payee (VoP) in the EU and other regions,
  allow payers or systems to check that a payee's name matches the account details provided. These services help prevent typographical errors, misdirected payments,
  and fraud before funds are transferred.

<h4>Common Verification Results</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Match:</strong> The payee name exactly matches the account details. Payment can proceed with confidence.</li>
  <li><strong>Partial Match:</strong> The payee name partially matches the account details (e.g., minor spelling differences). Users or systems may require additional confirmation.</li>
  <li><strong>No Match:</strong> The payee name does not match the account details. Payment should be stopped or reviewed to avoid errors or potential fraud.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These results are common across both CoP and VoP implementations, though specific handling, terminology, and regulatory requirements may vary by region.
</p>



 
  <h3>Why these checks matter</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Prevent misdirected payments and reduce refund workload.</li>
    <li>Mitigate authorised push payment (APP) and other account-targeted fraud.</li>
    <li>Improve customer confidence by displaying verification results before payment confirmation.</li>
  </ul>

             
              <h2 class="page-header">AIS Mode</h2>
            <p>Account Holder Verification allows you to leverage the power of <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.ais}}">Open Banking Account Information Service</a> to verify if user details, held by you, match the account details stored at the user's bank.</p>

            {% include tip.html content="Want to start testing? See the <a href='prod_overview.html'> Getting Started </a> section to request an API Key for the Nuapay Sandbox." %}

            <p>Open Banking Account Information Service (AIS) allows merchants, via the Nuapay TPP, to verify account ownership of individuals. The solution has been designed to be flexible enough to be used for various use cases. </p>
            <p> For example:<p>
              <ul>
              <li> A merchant may want to issue a payout (via the <a href= "np_createctandbene.html">Create Credit Transfer & Beneficiary</a> API) but first wants to confirm that the customer name that the merchant holds is the same as the account name into which the payment will be made. </li>
              <li> If the user is Tommy Smith, for example, the merchant can use the Verification service to request the user to grant consent to view account details at his bank.</li>
              <li> If the account holder name returned by the bank is Thomas Smith, the name matching algorithm will result in a 100% match, so the merchant can be confident that the payment that is about to be made is going to go to the correct beneficiary</li>
              </ul>

              {% include note.html content="Name matching will return a match score; 100% is used for exact or very close matches. Merchants will need to determine what scores are acceptable and will need to determine the risk and value of transaction when deciding on how to proceed where the verification matching score is less than 100%" %}

              <p>Customer verification is a 2-step process:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Request the Customer consent to retrieve account details from the bank.</li>
              <li>Using the retrieved account details, calculate a verification score against data that the client already holds (i.e., the customer’s name).
              Currently the matching is carried out only on the customer’s name.</li>
              </ul>

                <ul>
                <li>Use the service to pass the account details to the target bank.</li>
                <li> The bank will perform the matching and return a score.</li>
                <li> Based on the score returned, you can decide on the next steps.</li>
                </ul>
