The Checkout option allows you to offer your payers a seamless electronic mandate sign up experience. When the payer clicks to sign the mandate, the mandate signing screen is presented as a pop-up window on top of the calling page.

To get going with the Checkout approach you will need to:

* Generate an E-Mandate token
* Add a few lines of JavaScript to your Web site.
* Use the `init()` method to render the E-Mandate pop-up.
* Register an E-mandate event handler.

To begin, you'll need an [E-Mandate token](em_token.html).
