The Direct API Integration gives you the most control over your integration with Nuapay.

With the Direct API Integration approach:

* You fully control the look and feel of your client application
* All account validations are handled by Nuapay so there's no need for any client-side pre-processing
* Sensitive account data is not stored on your side at any point so no need to worry about managing your customers' sensitive data
* Email notifications are provided by default, however you will need to configure your required domain.
