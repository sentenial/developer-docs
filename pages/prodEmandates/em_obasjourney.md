For Merchants/Partners who are using either the `CHECKOUT` or `REDIRECT` integration approach to set up a subscription, the following gives a summary of the user's interaction.

## The User Experience

{% include tip.html content="The following screens are taken from the Bacs Direct Debit (GBP) signup process; the SEPA flow has a similar set of steps." %}

To use the service (for Bacs in GBP currency), the user:

1. Click the **Setup Subscription** button on the merchantâ€™s payment page (in `CHECKOUT` or `REDIRECT` mode):

1. The user is redirected to the selected bank, logs on, gives consent to the account access request, selects an account and is redirected back to Nuapay to the mandate (<a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.ddi}}">DDI</a>) signup screen:
<img src = "images/obem_acc_mandSignup.png">
1. Note that the Account Holder Name, Sort Code and Account Number are pre-populated.
1. The user selects the check box to confirm account ownership, and that he/she is the sole signatory on the account, and clicks **Sign**. A Confirmation screen is displayed:

Once the mandate/<a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.ddi}}">DDI</a> is signed, you can set up a schedule of payments for the subscription. See the [Direct Debit Overview](np_ddoverview.html) section for more information on how Direct Debit payments work.
