The following user interface elements can be configured for you by the Nuapay Client Support team, please discuss your requirements with your Account Manager.

## Logo Configuration

It is possible to define the logo that is displayed on the E-Mandate screens and also in e-mail communications to your customers (e.g. in the notice of mandate activation e-mails).

|Description| A logo displayed on E-Mandate screens and in e-mail communications |
|Example| <img src = "images/em_logo.png">|
|Default| Not Set |

If you would like to set up the logo, please provide a URL reference for the logo to your Account Manager (e.g. the URL to the logo you use on your Web site); the Nuapay Client Support team will handle the configuration.

## Debtor Communication

You may configure E-Mandates to dispatch email communications to your users in response to certain events. When enabled, and depending on your overall configuration, users will receive emails that:

* Prompt them to sign an e-mandate
* Give them the authentication code to sign mandates (if the authorisation method is via email).
* Confirm activation

In addition you, as a merchant, may be configured to receive an email notifying you when a mandate has been signed. (This feature is more appropriate for smaller merchants).

By default, email will be issued with the sender domain = Sentenial e.g. `emandates@sentenial.com`.

If you would prefer to use your own domain in the email notifications, it is possible to configure this but you will need to make some modifications at your DNS Provider: see [Email Customisation](em_communications.html) for more on this.


## Primary and Border Colours

The **Primary** value defines the button and spinner colours on the E-Mandate screens:

|Description| Customisation of the E-Mandate button colour scheme |
|Example| <img src = "images/em_primary.png">|
|Default| Primary: Orange (##FFC727)|

In addition to the Primary colour, the Nuapay Support team can also configure the border colour displayed on email notifications.

|Description| Customisation of the email border colour |
|Example| <img src = "images/em_borderColour.png">|
|Default| Orange (#FFCD02) |

## White Labelling

By default the E-Mandate screens display a 'Powered by' logo in the footer area of the E-Mandate screen. If required, it is possible to hide this icon.

|Description| The Powered by logo is displayed in the footer area.|
|Example| <img src = "images/em_poweredby.png">|
|Default| True |


## Extended Data
{% include tip.html content="Controlling the number of fields that may be displayed is allowable for the SEPA scheme only." %}

* Depending on your business needs you may already have specific customer details (address details for example) and you may just want to collect your customerâ€™s account details.
* The Extended Data configuration allows you to control what details you are prompting for on the E-Mandate signup form: you can prompt for all fields or just the mandatory fields.

|Description| Control what form data to display.|
|Example| <img src = "images/em_extended.png">|
|Default| True |

If required you can refine what elements of the extended screen are displayed. One or more of the following elements may be hidden if required:

* Address
* Mobile Number
* Contract Reference

Please discuss your specific requirements with your Account Manager.

{% include note.html content="For Bacs, all details must be collected so the extended data must always be displayed to your users." %}

## Debtor Input Control

Similar to the extended data configuration, in some cases you may have already collected your users' details (including account details) and simply require them to sign the mandate.

The Debtor Input setting allows you to manage the user interface in this scenario.

|Description| Control whether the data on the e-Mandate page can be edited or not|
|Default| True: editing of fields by the debtor is allowed |

Where Debtor Input Allowed = false you must ensure that account details and all mandatory fields are provided in the Prepare E-Mandate request (`POST /emandates`).   

## Success & Failure URLs

Once your customers have completed the E-mandate signing process you can define what confirmation or Failure screen is displayed.

If you have specific requirements around what screens to display here, for example if you want to seamlessly integrate the E-Mandate signup process into your existing payment page, please provide the required URLs to your Account Manager and Nuapay Support will do the rest!

For **Success**:

|Description| Success - the e-mandate has been signed |
|Default| https://customer.nuapay.com/successful-sign-up/ |

For **Failure**:

|Description| Failure - where something has gone wrong and the mandate has not been signed|
|Default| https://customer.nuapay.com/mandate-signing-issue/ |
