Webhooks are HTTP notifications, dispatched to a specified URL when certain events are triggered.

For more information on the setup and configuration of Webhooks, see the general [Webhooks section](wh_overview.html) (under the Products menu).

* When working with E-Mandates, the Mandate Signature Webhook notification is useful
* This notification will let you know when your customer has signed a mandate.

Note that other Webhook notifications related to direct debit updates may also be useful once an e-mandate has been signed. For more details on those notifications, see [Webhooks for Direct Debits and Credit Transfers](np_whoverview.html).
