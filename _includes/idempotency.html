## Idempotency

{% include tip.html content="We recommend that you use a unique idempotency key when working with this endpoint. The **Idempotency-Key** is a Header parameter in this API." %}


The Idempotency check is only against successful requests, so where a previous call has resulted in any of the following [HTTP Response Codes](np_httpreasons.html), that Idempotency key may be reused without any issue:

* `401`
* `403`
* `404`
* `408`
* `500`
* `501`
* `503`
